      <h1>Project description.</h1>

      <p>Using the Javascript framework of your choice, build an application that has two pages users can navigate to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"/search" lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)</li>
        <li>"/history" shows the users a list of their past searches from this session (these do not need to persist through refresh).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We're looking to see what you know in Javascript, querying an API, and state management. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design/UI (for this project).</p>
